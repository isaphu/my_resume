              <p>As a Digital Help Volunteer, my main goal is to increase technology literacy and confidence within the local community. Many essential services have moved online, leaving some members of the community behind.</p>

              <p>I conduct basic computer classes that break down intimidating tech concepts into simple, manageable steps. Beyond the classroom, I provide one-on-one "Digital Help" support. This involves helping seniors set up new devices (phones, tablets) and assisting them in navigating and filling out complex online forms for government or essential services.</p>
              <p>One memorable experience was helping Orietta, a lady from South America, set up her very first MacBook. We spent time walking through the interface until she felt comfortable navigating it on her own. Seeing her transition from uncertainty to confidence was incredibly rewarding, and it reinforces my belief that technology should be intuitive and inclusive for everyone.</p>

            <p>My role was fast-paced and dynamic. I supported day-to-day operations including gate control and ticket scanning, with a particular focus on assisting spectators with disabilities and ensuring accessibility needs were met. This experience helped me develop patience and confidence in high-pressure environments, while always prioritising a safe and welcoming experience for everyone.</p>  
            <p>I also worked as a Press Coordinator and assisted the <strong>Olympic Broadcasting Service (OBS)</strong>. This gave me a unique behind-the-scenes perspective on how a global sporting event is broadcast to millions, requiring quick problem-solving and precise communication with international media teams.</p>
